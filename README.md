***READ-ME***

Here in this repo I will be documenting some of my GIT notes and screenshots to help further develop my knowledge in it.

Can you make this linkedin post have bold headers for the beginning

Absolutely! Here's a polished LinkedIn post about using inotifywait:


---

üñ•Ô∏è Just had some fun with inotifywait ‚Äî a seriously underrated tool for real-time file monitoring in Linux.

I built a lightweight script that watches a directory and instantly reacts when files are created, modified, or deleted. No constant polling, no cron jobs ‚Äî just real-time event handling using the power of inotify.

It‚Äôs now:

Auto-compiling markdown notes when I save them

Kicking off image processing when new files drop into a folder

Sending me a notification when config files change


All done in pure Bash with a tiny footprint. Perfect for lightweight automation or prototyping before reaching for heavier tools.

If you haven‚Äôt messed with inotify-tools, give it a shot. It opens the door to a lot of creative, event-driven workflows on your local machine.
